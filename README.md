## Get started:

```sh
cd notes
yarn

# Install Million onto your machine
npx million@latest

# Run app
yarn start
```

## Task

Your job is to create a DAG/some graph of the data within `DATA.json`. You should try to interpret the data in a way that makes it easy to find _real_ performance problems inside the app. You should try our Million Lint first to see how we do it.

Performance data is located in `DATA.json`. If you want to generate your own, run Million Lint and then run `Cmd + Shift + P` and type `Million: Create checkpoint`.
